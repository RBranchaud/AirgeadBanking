Module 8 Prompt

Q: Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
A: This project was a collaboration with Airgead Banking. The initial focus was to develop and application to allow users to see their investments grow at specific time intervals with and without monthly deposits.

Q: What did you do particularly well?
A: I'd like to believe my coded screen display has an appealing look to it and would be noticed by users.

Q: Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
A: There's numerous repeated lines throughout the screen display code that could have been a simple function I called on when needed. It would probably make the code look sleaker and be debugged easier.

Q: Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
A: Honestly, lining everything up on the screen display side for user appeal took me the longest. I debugged and reran my screen display probably 100+ times before I got it right. I had to walk away numerous times for either an hour or two or sometimes entire days before returning to this specific code.

Q: What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
A: Besides creating and compiling a portion of a banking app, the skill I thought improved the most was my debugging. In doing so, MANY times as stated above, I began to realize my reoccuring errors and have begun to correct them as I code.

Q: How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
A: The code uses best practices taught in this class so it's easily read by other students and professors. And the user interface maintains a loop that increases user friendly qualities of life.
